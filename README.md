The Art Dealer Game

Project 4 for UMSL cs4500 Spring 2020 by Team 4

For reference, here's the text from the Potential Projects document:

    The Art Dealer Game: This is a game that I often play when I teach
    software engineering face-to-face. Students are told that an “art
    dealer” wants to “buy” paintings represented by playing cards from
    a traditional poker deck of 52 cards. Student attempt to discover
    what kinds of cards (“paintings”) the art dealer is buying. At
    each turn, a student lays out 4 cards from their deck, and observe
    what the art dealer buys. The turns continue until the student can
    do two things: put out four cards, all of which the art dealer
    buys; and the student can describe what kind of cards the art
    dealer is buying. For K-2, the patterns will be simple: all red,
    all black, all hearts, all queens, and so forth. For 3-5, the
    patterns will include the easy ones from K-2, but will then
    progress to tougher patterns: for example, one pattern might be
    all single digit primes, or collections of cards that add to 9, or
    an ace and a black jack. For grades 6-8, all of the previous
    patterns will be possible, but even more complex patterns will be
    introduced, including several kinds of combinations useful in
    poker. Finally, students in 6-8 will be able to play the game with
    each other, one of the students being the art dealer, and the
    other being the art seller.
